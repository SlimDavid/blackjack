Way of working
==============
* Clone this repository to your account
* Write some code for this week's task
* Remember to make small commits
* Push your code to a branch on your github account before next
  meeting (do not have to be a complete solution)
* (OPTIONAL) add a pull request for your solution before next meeting.
  This makes it easier to review everyones code, since we will have
  everything in one place.
* On the next meeting we review the submitted code and decide how to
  merge
